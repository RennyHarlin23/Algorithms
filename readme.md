<h2> Algorithms </h2>
<hr>
<p>
These are some algorithms that I learnt in my algorithms course in college as well as some I probably solved when I was free.

My plan is to keep this repository updated with the algorithms I might learn in future as well.

Problems solved till now:
1. Two sum
2. Reverse Polish Notation
3. Peak finding
4. Valid paranthesis
5. Kth largest element using merge sort
6. Minimum path sum using dp without memoization (Must do that sometime) 
7. Counting Bits 
8. Best Time to buy and sell stock using dynamic programming - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)
9. Longest common subsequence - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/)

11. Unique paths - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/)

Thanks for coming by.
