<h2> Algorithms </h2>
<hr>
<p>
These are some algorithms that I learnt in my algorithms course in college as well as some I probably solved when I was free.

My plan is to keep this repository updated with the algorithms I might learn in future as well.

Problems solved till now:
1. Two sum
2. Reverse Polish Notation
3. Peak finding
4. Valid paranthesis
5. Kth largest element using merge sort
6. Minimum path sum - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/description/)
7. Counting Bits 
8. Longest common subsequence - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/)
9. House robber - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/)
10. Unique paths - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/)

Thanks for coming by.
