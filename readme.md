<h1> Algorithms
<hr>
<h2> These are some algorithms that I learnt in my algorithms course in college as well as some I probably solved when I was free.

## My plan is to keep this repository updated with the algorithms I might learn in future as well.

## Problems solved till now:
1. Two sum
2. Reverse Polish Notation
3. Peak finding
4. Valid paranthesis

## Thanks for coming by.
