## Algorithms 

These are some algorithms that I learnt in my algorithms course in college as well as some I probably solved when I was free.

My plan is to keep this repository updated with the algorithms I might learn in future as well.

Problems solved till now:
1. Two sum
    a. First approach is to use two for loops takes a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(1)
    b. Anything with this complexity can always be brought down to O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity with the help of hashmaps => Optimal Solution
2. Reverse Polish Notation
3. Peak finding
4. Valid paranthesis
5. Best time to buy and sell stock - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)
6. Minimum path sum - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/description/)
7. Counting Bits 
8. Longest common subsequence - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/)
